Elder Skills

This is a proof of concept mini modpack. The idea is to store skill experience in player NBT data, adding to them when the skill is used. There are a number of event scripts that need to be written for this concept to work, but so far this covers attacking with swords, axes, and bows, some of Electroblob's Wizardry, and also running, swimming, and acrobatics. The chat log spam is to show that everything is working as intended, and XP totals will be printed to chat when you relog.
